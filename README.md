# My_Portfolio_Website
Portfolio is a User-Friendly Web Page. It is a great way to let people know about me. It is my personal storyboard where people can find me and stay updated on my activity.
The webpage is made using HTML and CSS.
Here people will be able to know about my education details, what skills I have gained, the projects that I have done and a list of my publications.
In the projects section they will be able to take a view of my projects. In the Publications section they can read my published articles.
After that there is a button named “Get In Touch” where they can Email me. Last but not the least, people can follow me in Linked In and Github.
Upon clicking the icon they will be redirected to the respective pages.
